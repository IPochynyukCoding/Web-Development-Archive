Programming Questions: (60 points)—Section 19174
Objective:

Develop a webpage that allows users to input numbers and manipulate arrays based on arithmetic sequences.

Tasks:

 

Create a folder named: Exam2-Firstname-Lastname-SectionNumber (e.g., Exam2­-Mark-Smith-19174). Put all your files inside this folder. (2 points)
User Input
Create a form on the webpage that:

requires users to input two positive even Ensure that the inputs validate for positiveness and evenness, and prompt an error if the conditions are not met. (15 points)
A submit button labeled as “Click Here to Generate Sequence” for user interaction. (3 points)
Implement the following items when the submit button is clicked:
Arithmetic Sequence Array Creation and Display (20 points)
Write a function to generate and display an arithmetic sequence array with a length of 50, using the two numbers entered by the user as the first two elements of the sequence. (Hint: calculate the common difference based on these two input numbers and use it to complete the sequence.)

Array Manipulation and Display (20 points)
Write a function to reverse the arithmetic sequence array and display it on the webpage.

Additional Requirements:

The webpage must handle user inputs robustly, providing feedback if the entered values do not meet the specified criteria of being positive and even.
Include clear labels on the form, set nice background color for input fields and the button to guide the user on what is expected.
Comment your code appropriately to explain your logic and any assumptions made.
Submission Instructions:

       1. Upload the zip folder on Canvas.

      2. Upload the folder on GitHub, using the github link
